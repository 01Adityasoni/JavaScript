#   JAVASCRIPT AND CLASSES 

# Do JavaScript really have classes ?

yes , js dose have classes , this feture introduced with the ECMAScript 2015 specification(often reffered to as ES6), However, its important to note that JavaScript is primarily a prototype-bases language,and its classes are primarily syntactuc suge over existing prototype-based inheritance machanisms. in other words, it provides a more familiar syntax for developers comming from class-based language such as java or cpp , but under the hood it works somwhat differently .. means it only synatx friendly with class but in background it is prototyped-based languag

# OOP(Object oriented programming) 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing code by using objects, just like real-world things.
Simple idea: Think about a Car 🚗
A car has:
Properties → color, model, speed
Actions → start, stop, accelerate
In OOP, we write code in the same way.


# Object
object is a real world entity that has state and behaviour
state means varialbes and constants and behaviour means functions , promises are also object 

# Why OOP
👉 “OOP is used to make software modular, reusable, secure, and easy to maintain by modeling real-world entities using objects and classes.”
We use Object-Oriented Programming because it makes code:
easy to understand
easy to manage
easy to reuse
easy to change later


# 4 Pillers
Abstraction -> Hiding the details for exp fetch(); Why fetch() is a perfect example of abstraction
When you use:
fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
You don’t know and don’t need to know:
how the HTTP request is created
how DNS works
how TCP connection happens
how data is received from the server
You just:
call fetch()
get the result
That is abstraction.

Encapsulation -> wrap the data 
Inheritance -> 
Polymorphism ->means many-forms
