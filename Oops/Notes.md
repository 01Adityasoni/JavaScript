#   JAVASCRIPT AND CLASSES 

# Do JavaScript really have classes ?

yes , js dose have classes , this feture introduced with the ECMAScript 2015 specification(often reffered to as ES6), However, its important to note that JavaScript is primarily a prototype-bases language,and its classes are primarily syntactuc suge over existing prototype-based inheritance machanisms. in other words, it provides a more familiar syntax for developers comming from class-based language such as java or cpp , but under the hood it works somwhat differently .. means it only synatx friendly with class but in background it is prototyped-based language
